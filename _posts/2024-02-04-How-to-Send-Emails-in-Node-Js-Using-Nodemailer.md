Sending emails is a fundamental task in many web applications â€” from user registration confirmations to password resets, invoices, and marketing campaigns. If youâ€™re building a Node.js app and need to send emails, **Nodemailer** is hands down the most popular and reliable library.

In this detailed guide, youâ€™ll learn:

- What Nodemailer is and why itâ€™s used
- How to install and configure Nodemailer
- How to send a simple email
- How to add attachments
- How to use HTML email templates
- How to integrate with services like Gmail, Outlook, SendGrid
- Common errors and how to fix them
- Best practices for production

By the end, you'll have a complete understanding and a practical working setup to send emails in your Node.js projects confidently.

Letâ€™s dive right in! ðŸš€

## What is Nodemailer?

[Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) is a Node.js module that enables you to easily send emails. It's a zero-dependency package â€” simple to set up and flexible enough to handle everything from basic messages to complex email services.

**Key Features of Nodemailer:**

- SMTP and other transport protocols supported
- Attachments support
- HTML content, embedded images
- OAuth2 authentication (for Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- Unicode support
- Ability to send bulk or scheduled emails

It's like having your own tiny mail server inside your app without needing to overcomplicate things.

## Setting Up Your Node.js Project

Before we start sending emails, letâ€™s set up our project.

### Step 1: Initialize a Node.js Project

```bash
mkdir nodemailer-tutorial
cd nodemailer-tutorial
npm init -y
```

This creates a `package.json` file.

### Step 2: Install Nodemailer

Now, install Nodemailer:

```bash
npm install nodemailer
```

Youâ€™re all set to begin coding!

---

## Sending Your First Email

Now let's get your first email sent.

### Step 1: Create a File

Create a file called `sendEmail.js`.

### Step 2: Basic Code to Send an Email

```javascript
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

// Create a transporter
let transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: 'gmail',
    auth: {
        user: 'your-email@gmail.com',
        pass: 'your-email-password'
    }
});

// Email options
let mailOptions = {
    from: 'your-email@gmail.com',
    to: 'recipient@example.com',
    subject: 'Hello from Node.js',
    text: 'This is a test email sent from Node.js using Nodemailer.'
};

// Send email
transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
    if (error) {
        console.log('Error occurred: ', error.message);
    } else {
        console.log('Email sent: ', info.response);
    }
});
```

Run it with:

```bash
node sendEmail.js
```

And if everything is set correctly, your email will be sent!

## Important Notes on Gmail

If you're using Gmail:

- **Less secure apps access** must be enabled on your account.
- Alternatively, you should use **OAuth2** authentication for better security (explained later).
- Google may block sign-in attempts; you might need to create an **App Password**.

---

## Understanding Nodemailer Components

Let's break down whatâ€™s happening:

| Component    | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| **Transporter** | A configuration that tells Nodemailer how to send emails (e.g., via Gmail SMTP). |
| **Mail Options** | The email content: from, to, subject, text, HTML, attachments, etc. |
| **sendMail()** | The method that actually sends the email. |

Once you understand these three, you can build any email functionality!

---

## Sending HTML Emails

Text emails are boring! Let's add some **HTML content**.

```javascript
let mailOptions = {
    from: 'your-email@gmail.com',
    to: 'recipient@example.com',
    subject: 'HTML Email Example',
    html: `<h1>Hello ðŸ‘‹</h1><p>This is an <b>HTML email</b> sent using Nodemailer!</p>`
};
```

HTML allows you to style your emails however you want.

You can even add inline CSS for beautiful designs.

---

## Adding Attachments

Need to send PDFs, images, or files?

Hereâ€™s how:

```javascript
let mailOptions = {
    from: 'your-email@gmail.com',
    to: 'recipient@example.com',
    subject: 'Sending Attachments',
    text: 'Please find attached files.',
    attachments: [
        {
            filename: 'document.txt',
            path: './document.txt'
        },
        {
            filename: 'image.png',
            path: './image.png'
        }
    ]
};
```

Nodemailer will handle the file encoding automatically. Easy!

---

## Embedding Images Inside Emails (Inline Images)

Sometimes you want to show images inside the email body, not just as attachments.

Example:

```javascript
let mailOptions = {
    from: 'your-email@gmail.com',
    to: 'recipient@example.com',
    subject: 'Email with Embedded Image',
    html: `<h1>Look at this image:</h1><img src="cid:unique@nodemailer.com"/>`,
    attachments: [{
        filename: 'image.png',
        path: './image.png',
        cid: 'unique@nodemailer.com' // same CID as in HTML
    }]
};
```

This displays the image *inside* the email rather than as a download.

---

## Using Email Templates

Hardcoding HTML is messy. Instead, use **templating engines** like **Handlebars**, **EJS**, or **Pug**.

Hereâ€™s a quick example using **Handlebars**:

### Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install nodemailer-express-handlebars
```

### Setup with Handlebars:

```javascript
const hbs = require('nodemailer-express-handlebars');
const path = require('path');

transporter.use('compile', hbs({
    viewEngine: {
        extName: '.hbs',
        partialsDir: path.resolve('./templates'),
        defaultLayout: false,
    },
    viewPath: path.resolve('./templates'),
    extName: '.hbs'
}));

let mailOptions = {
    from: 'your-email@gmail.com',
    to: 'recipient@example.com',
    subject: 'Welcome Email',
    template: 'welcome', // name of your file 'welcome.hbs'
    context: {
        name: 'John Doe',
        company: 'NodeMailer Inc.'
    }
};
```

In `templates/welcome.hbs`:

```html
<h1>Hello {{name}}</h1>
<p>Welcome to {{company}}!</p>
```

Dynamic, clean, and easy to maintain.

## Integrating with Popular Email Services

Instead of sending directly via SMTP, you can use email providers.

Hereâ€™s a quick setup:

### Gmail

(Already shown above, with `service: 'gmail'`.)

### Outlook

```javascript
service: 'hotmail',
auth: {
    user: 'your-email@hotmail.com',
    pass: 'your-password'
}
```

### SendGrid

For bulk transactional emails:

```javascript
host: 'smtp.sendgrid.net',
port: 587,
auth: {
    user: 'apikey',
    pass: 'YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY'
}
```

More reliable than Gmail for production.

---

## Handling Errors

When sending emails, errors can happen:

- Wrong credentials
- SMTP server unavailable
- Invalid recipient email
- Attachments missing

You should wrap `sendMail()` in a `try-catch` block:

```javascript
async function sendEmail() {
    try {
        let info = await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);
        console.log('Email sent: ', info.response);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error sending email: ', error.message);
    }
}
```

Always validate user input too!

---

## Common Errors and Fixes

| Error  | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| `Invalid login` | Check your email and password or OAuth2 settings |
| `Connection timeout` | SMTP server unreachable; check host/port |
| `Blocked by Gmail` | Enable less secure apps or use App Passwords |
| `Self-signed certificate error` | Add `tls: { rejectUnauthorized: false }` in transporter |

Example adding TLS settings:

```javascript
let transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    host: 'smtp.example.com',
    port: 587,
    secure: false,
    auth: {
        user: 'your-email@example.com',
        pass: 'your-password'
    },
    tls: {
        rejectUnauthorized: false
    }
});
```

## Advanced: Sending Bulk Emails

Sending thousands of emails? Use **loops + delays** to avoid hitting limits:

Example:

```javascript
const recipients = ['a@example.com', 'b@example.com', 'c@example.com'];

recipients.forEach((email, index) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        transporter.sendMail({
            from: 'your-email@gmail.com',
            to: email,
            subject: 'Personalized Email',
            text: `Hello ${email}, this is a test.`
        }, (err, info) => {
            if (err) {
                console.log(`Error sending to ${email}:`, err.message);
            } else {
                console.log(`Email sent to ${email}:`, info.response);
            }
        });
    }, index * 2000); // 2-second delay between emails
});
```

This way, you won't overwhelm the server.

## Best Practices for Emailing

- Use a **dedicated email service** (SendGrid, Mailgun) in production.
- Validate all email inputs.
- Avoid sending sensitive information unencrypted.
- Always catch and log errors.
- If sending bulk, add delays or use services built for bulk mailing.
- Monitor your email sending rates and bounce rates.
