# Advanced Scraping with Puppeteer: Techniques for Reliable, Scalable, and Stealthy Scrapers

In the [previous guide](https://wackydawg.github.io/web-scraping/Building-a-Web-Scraper-in-Node-Js-with-Puppeteer/), we learned how to **build a basic web scraper using Node.js and Puppeteer**. We scraped quotes, handled pagination, and saved results into a file.

But real-world scraping often gets more **complex**:

- Websites detect and block bots.
- Captchas appear unexpectedly.
- Data loads asynchronously.
- Pages require user authentication.
- IPs get banned after too many requests.

In this **advanced guide**, we'll dive deep into real-world challenges and learn **powerful techniques** to make your **Puppeteer scrapers faster, stealthier, and more reliable**.

We'll cover:

- Headless browser detection & stealth mode
- Using proxies
- Handling captchas
- Managing sessions, cookies, and authentication
- Speed optimization techniques
- Running scrapers at scale
- Error recovery and retries

Let's get into it! ðŸ”¥

## 1. Headless Browser Detection and Stealth Mode

**Problem**:  
Websites can detect Puppeteer bots because browsers running in headless mode leave tell-tale signs:

- Missing plugins
- `navigator.webdriver` set to `true`
- Strange screen resolutions or languages

**Solution**:  
Use **`puppeteer-extra`** and **`puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth`** to make Puppeteer look like a real user.

### Install stealth plugin:

```bash
npm install puppeteer-extra puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth
```

### Modify your scraper:

```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer-extra');
const StealthPlugin = require('puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth');

puppeteer.use(StealthPlugin());

(async () => {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: true });
    const page = await browser.newPage();

    await page.goto('https://bot.sannysoft.com'); // Tests bot detection
    await page.screenshot({ path: 'stealth_test.png' });

    await browser.close();
})();
```

ðŸ”¹ **Result**: Your scraper now looks like a normal user browsing!

## 2. Using Proxies to Avoid IP Bans

**Problem**:  
Sending 1000s of requests from the same IP address can trigger bans.

**Solution**:  
Use **proxies** (rotating residential proxies, datacenter proxies, or even your own servers).

### Using a proxy with Puppeteer:

```javascript
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    args: ['--proxy-server=http://username:password@proxyserver:port']
});
```

Example:

```javascript
args: ['--proxy-server=http://123.45.67.89:8080']
```

If your proxy requires authentication:

```javascript
await page.authenticate({
    username: 'your-username',
    password: 'your-password'
});
```

### Proxy Rotation (Simple Example):

If you have multiple proxies:

```javascript
const proxies = [
    'http://user:pass@proxy1:port',
    'http://user:pass@proxy2:port',
    'http://user:pass@proxy3:port'
];

const randomProxy = proxies[Math.floor(Math.random() * proxies.length)];

const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    args: [`--proxy-server=${randomProxy}`]
});
```

ðŸ”¹ **Tip**: Services like BrightData, Oxylabs, or Smartproxy offer thousands of rotating IPs.

## 3. Handling Captchas Automatically

**Problem**:  
Captcha challenges can stop your scrapers.

**Solution**:  
You can either:

- Solve simple captchas with image recognition (hard!).
- Use external solving services like **2Captcha** or **AntiCaptcha**.

---

### Example using 2Captcha:

Install `2captcha` npm package:

```bash
npm install 2captcha
```

Solve a captcha:

```javascript
const solver = require('2captcha')('YOUR_2CAPTCHA_API_KEY');

solver.solveImage('captcha.png').then(
    (text) => console.log('Captcha text:', text),
    (err) => console.error('Error:', err)
);
```

You can take a **screenshot of the captcha** in Puppeteer and send it to the solver!

---

### (Optional) ReCaptcha Solver Plugin for Puppeteer:

```bash
npm install puppeteer-extra-plugin-recaptcha
```

```javascript
const RecaptchaPlugin = require('puppeteer-extra-plugin-recaptcha');

puppeteer.use(
    RecaptchaPlugin({
        provider: {
            id: '2captcha',
            token: 'YOUR_2CAPTCHA_API_KEY'
        },
        visualFeedback: true
    })
);

await page.solveRecaptchas();
```

ðŸ”¹ **Result**: Your scraper bypasses ReCaptcha v2 automatically!

---

## 4. Managing Sessions, Cookies, and Authentication

**Problem**:  
Many sites require login before scraping.

**Solution**:  
Simulate logging in and **save your session cookies** for later use.

---

### Example: Login and save cookies:

```javascript
await page.goto('https://example.com/login');
await page.type('#email', 'your-email@example.com');
await page.type('#password', 'your-password');
await page.click('#submit');
await page.waitForNavigation();

const cookies = await page.cookies();
fs.writeFileSync('cookies.json', JSON.stringify(cookies, null, 2));
```

### Later, reuse cookies:

```javascript
const cookies = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('cookies.json'));
await page.setCookie(...cookies);
await page.goto('https://example.com/dashboard');
```

ðŸ”¹ **Result**: No need to log in every time! Saves time and reduces load.

---

## 5. Speed Optimization Techniques

**Problem**:  
Scraping large websites is **slow**.

**Solutions**:

- Disable images, stylesheets, fonts
- Set fast timeout settings
- Use parallel browsers

---

### Block unnecessary requests:

```javascript
await page.setRequestInterception(true);

page.on('request', (req) => {
    if (['stylesheet', 'font', 'image'].includes(req.resourceType())) {
        req.abort();
    } else {
        req.continue();
    }
});
```

ðŸ”¹ **Result**: 2-5x faster scraping!

---

### Increase parallelism:

Instead of scraping pages sequentially, run multiple browser instances:

```javascript
Promise.all([
    scrapePage('https://site.com/page1'),
    scrapePage('https://site.com/page2'),
    scrapePage('https://site.com/page3')
]);
```

(But beware of overloading the target website!)

---

## 6. Error Recovery and Retry Mechanisms

**Problem**:  
Web pages sometimes fail to load, elements are missing, or network issues occur.

**Solution**:  
Use **retry logic**.

---

### Retry wrapper example:

```javascript
async function retryRequest(page, url, retries = 3) {
    for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++) {
        try {
            await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded', timeout: 30000 });
            return;
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`Failed attempt ${i + 1} for ${url}`);
            if (i === retries - 1) throw error;
            await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 2000));
        }
    }
}
```

ðŸ”¹ **Result**: More stable scrapers that survive temporary issues.

---

## 7. Running Scrapers at Scale

Once your scraper works reliably, you might want to **scale** to hundreds of thousands of pages!

Some tools and techniques:

- **Cluster Management**: Use `puppeteer-cluster` for automatic job distribution.
- **Docker Containers**: Deploy scrapers as lightweight containers.
- **Headless Chrome Servers**: Run multiple headless browsers on cloud servers.
- **Queue Systems**: Use Redis or RabbitMQ to manage scraping queues.

---

## Bonus: Puppeteer-Cluster Example

`puppeteer-cluster` allows running many pages in parallel without manual thread management!

Install:

```bash
npm install puppeteer-cluster
```

Example:

ðŸ”¹ **Result**: Efficient, concurrent scraping at scale!
